# Coding Challenge Rules

1. Create a react application that allows users to click the screen and leave a dot (20px x 20px)

2. Create an "undo" button that allows the user to remove the last dot. It can be clicked as many times as wanted. (removing all dots)

3. create a "redo" button that puts the dot back on the screen. It can be clicked as many times as wanted. (restoring all dots)
